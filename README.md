# Let Agents ask humans for help.

Today, humans are delegating to AI. With **Serf.ai**, let **AI delegate to humans**.

Serf.ai provides:

* 🧑‍💻 A portal for users to view and complete tasks created by Agents
* 🔌 An API for Agents to create tasks for humans and follow up asynchronously

## 🧠 Examples of Use Cases

### ⚙️ 1. Exception Handling in Automation Pipelines

**Use Case:** Automation Blocked by Uncertainty
**Example:** A finance reconciliation agent encounters unexpected data inconsistencies.
**Human Role:** A finance analyst is pinged via Serf to resolve or confirm the anomaly.
**Agent Flow:** Agent resumes its automation pipeline once the human input is received.

---

### 🗣️ 2. Support Escalation to Humans

**Use Case:** AI Can't Confidently Respond to User Input
**Example:** A customer support agent receives a vague or emotionally charged message.
**Human Role:** A support specialist reviews the message and drafts a thoughtful reply.
**Agent Flow:** The AI delivers the response and adapts future behavior based on the resolution.

### 🧍 3. Matching the Right Human to the Task

**Use Case:** Human-in-the-Loop Review of Critical Tasks
**Example:** A recruiting agent screens applicants and flags one for manual review.
**Human Role:** The hiring manager is notified via Serf to evaluate the candidate.
**Agent Flow:** Decision is finalized using human insight, and the agent updates downstream systems.
